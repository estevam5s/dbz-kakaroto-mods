BEFORE USING THIS MOD, PLEASE BACKUP YOUR SAVE, SO IN ANY CASE OF ISSUE YOUR PROGRESS WON'T BE CORRUPTED!!!

This mod is intended to use in endgame!

Versus Mode is only compatible with the vanilla game and my mods! Any other mods are causing errors in it's operation.

To make this mod work you have to use the following structure:
VersusCustomTitles.pak (this file is responsible to show the custom titles in the game, without the menus would be blank)

IMPORTANT: if your menus are blank despite using the CustomTitles, it means you are using another mod which conflicts Versus Mode. Solution: remove any other mods, besides mine and use a clean unmodded save file!

One difficulty file, depends on your choice (lvl100, 200, 300basic, 300expert, 300hard, 300extreme)!

Map files:
VersusMapChange.pak (MUST HAVE, because without it you can't transfer between custom unlocked stages)!
VersusMapDLC2CloudyWasteland.pak (unlocks DLC2 Cloudy Map with closer trainingpoints and interest near Golden Frieza )!
VersusMapDLC3RuinedCityDay.pak or VersusMapDLC3RuinedCityNight.pak (depends on your choice)!
VersusMapDLC4PlanetVegeta.pak (unlocks other planets from Planet Vegeta's Space Pod platform)!
VersusMapDLC5WorldTournament.pak (unlocks DB related maps in DLC5)!
VersusMapFightInsideCity.pak or VersusMapFightOutsideCity.pak (depends on your choice)!
VersusMapKorinTowerBig.pak (needs for DLC5 ground battle at Korin's Tower because the original map was small caused the enemy fall down from the stage)!
VersusMapSpaceEarth.pak (it changes Planet Vegeta's Space map to Earth's Space Map )
