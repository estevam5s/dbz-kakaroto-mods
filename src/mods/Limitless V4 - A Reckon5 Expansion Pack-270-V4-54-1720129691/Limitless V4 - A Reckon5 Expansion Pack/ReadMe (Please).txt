Hi all! Hope you all enjoy this! I put loads of time into this! Please consider giving the mod a thumbs up if you haven't already :) - Reckon

Please read the Change Log on the mod page to see what is new!

ssjatys advanced varient information:
ssjatys mod is now works with Limitless (Yippie!), so there's a few things I want to mention first.

Firstly, massive thank you to him for working with me to make this possible, he is a very talented modder!

Secondly, when you download the mod, you will see two files. Installing either one is fine (not both), but go with
"250_AdvancedVariant_ThreeMainGohan_P" just incase. Just for good measure, put a "z" infront of the name of the mod so it looks like 
"z250_AdvancedVariant_ThreeMainGohan_P"

If all goes well, you should be able to play with all the playable characters! ^_^

Bugs and such:
If you run into a small bug, please report it either to my discord or the main page.
If you run into a game breaking bug, please do the same thing also, or feel free to @ me in discord. I treat game breaking mods with urgency.
If you run into a glitch, for example, MUI won't transform, missing text or any other error, this is likely caused by a conflicting mod. Please remove it
to ensure Limitless works as intended. I would not realease a broken mod, everything is tested before release :)

In this folder, I have also provided my personal load order/ ~mods folder. This is what I use anytime I run Kakarot, so feel free to copy it! I have 0 errors or bugs
so if this is something you're having trouble with, please try it out!

For any other issues, please message the support channel in my discord!

Enjoy!!
